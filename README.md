# Interrupt Controller Simulation in Java

## Introduction
This Java program simulates an **Interrupt Controller System** that handles interrupts generated by different devices such as a keyboard, mouse, and printer.  
The program demonstrates how interrupts are triggered, prioritized, masked, and processed in an operating system–like environment using **threads** and **synchronization**.

---

## Objective
- To simulate interrupt handling using Java programming.
- To demonstrate **interrupt masking**, **prioritization**, and **logging**.
- To understand how **threads** and **synchronization** manage concurrent events.

---

## Description
The program contains two main classes:

### **1. InterruptController**
This class manages:
- The **interrupt queue** (to store incoming interrupts).
- The **masking mechanism** (to enable or disable specific devices).
- The **ISR handler thread** (to process interrupts in priority order).
- The **log** (to store handled interrupts and timestamps).

**Key methods:**
- `triggerInterrupt()` – Simulates interrupt generation by a device.  
- `setMask()` – Masks or unmasks interrupts for a device.  
- `startISRHandler()` – Starts the background thread that handles interrupts.  
- `printLog()` – Prints all processed interrupts.

### **2. Main**
This class:
- Creates an `InterruptController` object.
- Starts the interrupt service routine handler.
- Randomly triggers interrupts from devices.
- Displays the interrupt handling log after execution.

---

## How the Program Works
1. Interrupts are randomly generated from devices.
2. If a device is **unmasked**, its interrupt is added to the queue.
3. The controller **sorts** the queue based on device priority.
4. A background thread **processes interrupts one by one**.
5. Each handled interrupt is **logged with timestamps**.
